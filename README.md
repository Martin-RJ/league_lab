# The League Lab Project aims at empowering low-league football clubs on data and statistics !

âš½ From scrapping to machine learning, univariate and bivariate analysis, here is everything you need to know about data and statistics in League One and League Two English football !

ðŸ“Š I am a Data Analyst, Digital Marketer and Journalist with a passion for anything football. 

ðŸ“‚ This repository is entirely my work, put together after office hours, as a hobby. It can obviously be improved but should work and give any football and data fan or any low-league club the ability to scrap, concatenate, visualize and analyze data.

ðŸŒŽ Based of Fbref data and built for EFL League One and EFL League Two, most of the material is customizable for any league in the world with a few twists here and there.
